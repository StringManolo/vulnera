Inyect this html directly on the username field.

In real scenario, this only works if there is usefull information after the login page or if the server has 2fa or other security features. 

The attacker would make a phishing website and once the visitor enter the credentials on the phishing site, the attacker would send the form with a submit using javascript.
This way the attacker dosn't need to log himself using the credentials, because is the user of the phishing site who will submit the form.

Once the user is logged in, the attacker can change do a second phishing attemp with html inyection. For example can trick the use to send a bank transaction, Tjis attack xan also be used in chaining attacks. For example in a referrer leak attack to extraxt exposed details in the url without never logining in the site.

Usually htmli is treated as xss. But it's not. You can't use javascript in this vulnerability.
