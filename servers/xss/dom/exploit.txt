VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
DOM XSS (Document Object Model Cross-Site Scripting) is a type of XSS attack where the vulnerability is in the client-side code rather than the server-side. It occurs when the web application's client-side scripts write user-controllable data to the DOM without proper sanitization or validation, leading to the execution of malicious scripts. This can result in unauthorized actions such as stealing session tokens, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent. Unlike traditional XSS, DOM XSS does not rely on the server to deliver the malicious payload; instead, it exploits the dynamic behavior of the client-side code.
