VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
A DNS zone transfer is a process used in Domain Name System (DNS) management to replicate DNS database information across multiple DNS servers, ensuring consistency and redundancy. This process typically involves a primary DNS server, which holds the original DNS records, and secondary DNS servers, which receive copies of these records through the zone transfer. While legitimate zone transfers are essential for maintaining DNS reliability and availability, improper configuration or unauthorized access can lead to security vulnerabilities, as attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information about the network structure and hosts within a domain.


EXPLOIT
If a DNS server allows AXFR zone transfers to any requester (instead of restricting them to authorized servers), an attacker could obtain a complete copy of the DNS zone. This could expose sensitive information about the network infrastructure, such as internal IP addresses and hostnames, making it easier to plan targeted attacks.
