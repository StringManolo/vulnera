If a DNS server allows AXFR zone transfers to any requester (instead of restricting them to authorized servers), an attacker could obtain a complete copy of the DNS zone. This could expose sensitive information about the network infrastructure, such as internal IP addresses and hostnames, making it easier to plan targeted attacks.
