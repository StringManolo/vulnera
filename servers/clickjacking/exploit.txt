VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
Clickjacking, also known as a UI redress attack, is a malicious technique where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives, effectively hijacking their clicks. This is often achieved by layering a transparent or opaque frame over legitimate clickable content, such as buttons or links, leading the user to perform actions they did not intend, such as divulging confidential information, unwittingly subscribing to services, or executing unauthorized transactions. The attack exploits the trust a user has in a legitimate website by overlaying deceptive elements, making it difficult for users to recognize the malicious activity.



EXPLOIT
How this works is:
1 - You visit a random web like example.com
2 - Example.com shows a normal url/link that you can click for examole to visit google.com
3 - Example.com adds an iframe pointing to the vulnerable web "Delete Account" button on top of the url/link that you are going to click
4 - Example.com sets the opacity of the iframe on top of the link to 0 so that it is not seen by you.
5 - You click the link and your account is deleted
6 - Since you can't see the iframe at all, you don't even notice that you have deleted your account.
7 - Example.com adds a listerner to the iframe so that when it is clicked it redirect you to google.com
* You will think you just clicked the link to go to google and got redirected to google.com, so you don't even notice that you have deleted your account. You will keeo your online activity on the web and probably you never understand why your account is deleted.
* In this example is a Delete Account, but perfectly could be a button to transfer money to another account.
