VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a critical web security vulnerability that allows attackers to trick users into performing actions they did not intend to on a web application where they are authenticated. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can execute unauthorized commands on behalf of the user, potentially leading to unauthorized transactions, data disclosure, sending messages on your own behalf, deleting your account, data manipulation, or other malicious activities. CSRF attacks exploit the trust a web application has in a user's browser by embedding malicious requests in seemingly innocuous content, such as a hidden form or a crafted URL, which the user's browser then automatically executes due to the existing authentication session. This can lead to severe security breaches, especially in sensitive applications like banking, social media or e-commerce platforms.
